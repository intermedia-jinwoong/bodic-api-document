# Basic Concepts of Pitch and Interval

## Equivalence

### Octave Equivalence[^1]

”Scale degree” implies an *equivalence* between [pitches](http://openmusictheory.com/pitches.html) that are spelled the same but any number of octaves apart. C4 is the same as C3 is the same as C9, and so on. The concept of scale degree, then, has the idea of *octave equivalence* embedded within it.



### Enharmonic Equivalence[^1]

Though *octave equivalence* is central to our understanding of tonal music, enharmonic equivalence often is not. In the key of C major, A-flat and G-sharp are *not* equivalent, though in isolation they sound the same. Spelling often indicates tendency: A-flat *falls* to G and G-sharp *rises* to A.

In post-tonal music, enharmonic equivalence is often assumed — with exceptions of course. Because many composers no longer felt constrained by a tonal center, the same gravitational relationships amongst tones that we find in tonal music aren’t important. A-flat and G-sharp, therefore, can be treated as representations of the same thing.



## Integer Notation[^1]

When analyzing post-tonal music where assuming octave equivalence and enharmonic equivalence is appropriate, we can use integers to represent pitch class. All C’s and any notes that are enharmonically-equivalent to C (B-sharp, for example) are pitch class 0. All C-sharps’s and any notes that are enharmonically-equivalent to C-sharp (D-flat, for example) are pitch class 1. And so on: C = 0, C-sharp = 1, D = 2, D-sharp = 3, E = 4, F = 5, F-sharp = 6, G = 7, G-sharp = 8, A = 9, B-flat = 10 (T), and B = 1 1 (E).

This type of pitch-class, which assumes octave and enharmonic equivalence is easily visualized on a clock-face diagram, like the one below.
